**Description:**

Imagery is a web-based application built with React that allows users to upload, edit, and apply various filters to their images in real time. It provides a user-friendly interface where users can adjust filter settings using sliders and see the changes immediately on the canvas.

**Key Features:**

- Image Upload: Users can upload their images from their local devices directly to the editor.
- Real-time Filters: The app supports a variety of filters, including brightness, saturation, contrast, blur, grayscale, opacity, hue-rotate, sepia, and inversion. Users can adjust these filter values using sliders, and the filtered image is instantly updated on the canvas.
- Live Preview: As users interact with the sliders, the edited image is displayed in real-time on the canvas, allowing for quick and intuitive adjustments.
- Save Edited Image: The app provides an option to save the edited image with the applied filters.

**Usage:**

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Start the development server using `npm start`.
4. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the Image Editor App.
5. Click on the "Choose File" button to upload your image.
6. Use the sliders to adjust the filter settings and see the live preview on the canvas.
7. Once you are satisfied with the edits, click on the save icon to download the edited image.
